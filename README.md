# Modelling the Equitable Near Optimal Feasible Space (MENOFS)

In energy systems modelling, the design of a future energy system is determined through cost-optimisation of the total system costs, but it is possible to attend to other aspects of energy systems, such as the distribution of benefits and burdens across space, time and society. Community perspectives on the fairness of e.g. wind power development (both its distribution and processes) is an important factor for its social acceptance (Gross, 2007) and for enabling a transition to low-carbon energy systems.

Using energy system models to analyse regional distribution of renewable electricity generation is a fairly new research approach with several unexplored sub-areas. Previous studies have identified among other things, a trade-off between least-cost and regional equity (Sasse & Trutnevyte, 2019, 2020) and a trilemma between cost-efficiency, equity and social acceptance for wind power expansion (Weinand et al., 2021). There are many ways to measure regional equity and while previous research mainly have focused on equitable distribution based on population and energy consumption, other approaches may provide new insight.
